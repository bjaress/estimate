If you have Docker, it's the easiest way to run the program:

    docker run bjaress/estimate --help

To bring the latest version into your Docker cache, use:

    docker pull bjaress/estimate

If you don't have Docker, the easiest way is to [install Docker][] and then
follow the instructions above.

You can also install [The Haskell Tool Stack][] to build and run the
program from source.
